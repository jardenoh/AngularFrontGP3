  <div class="FAQ">
    <h1>Why OptimalPC?</h1>
    <p>Building your own PC offers the benefits of customization, long-term cost efficiency, and upgrade
       flexibility, allowing you to tailor your system to meet your exact needs. However, for new and veteran 
       builders alike, building an updated PC can quickly become overwhelming. From spending hours pouring through 
       forum posts only to be met with stalwart opinions and recommendations, and new parts seemingly releasing 
       every week, the idea of building a PC made to last becomes a dreadful, almost impossible task for many. OptimalPC 
       is working to fix this. By using AI to offer precise, objective recommendations, we aim to lower the difficulty 
       threshold and make PC building easier and more accessible than ever before.
      </p>

      <h1>Why not some other AI tool?</h1>
      <p>Many large language models are only trained up to a certain date and have limited knowledge on PC parts, so 
        any recommendations they make can be inaccurate or extremely out of date. OptimalPC uses an open-source database 
        of released parts that's constantly and consistently updated. Of course, as with any AI tool, we highly recommend 
        running any part recommendations by a trusted professional before making any purchases.</p>
